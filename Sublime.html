    <h2>Some features our users <em>love</em>:</h2>
    <br>
    <b>GOTO ANYTHING</b>
    <p></p>
    <p>Use <em>Goto Anything</em> to open files wilth only a few keystrokes, and instantly jump to symbols, lines or words.</p>
    <p> Triggered with <button><code>Ctrl</code></button>+<button><code>P</code></button>, it is possible to:</p>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Type part of a file name to  open it.</li>
        <li>Type <code>@</code> to jump to symbols, <code>#</code> to search within file, and <code>:</code> to go to a line number.</li>   
         </ul>
    <br>
    <p>These shortcuts can be combined, so <code>tp@rf</code> may take you to a function <small><u>read_file</u></small> wthin a file <small><u>text_parse.py.</u></small> Smilarly, <code>to:100</code>
    woild take you to line 100 of same file.</p> 
    <br>
    <b>GOTO TO DEFINITION</b>
    <br>
    <p>
      Using information from synax definitios.Submile Text automatically generates a project-wide index of every class, method and funtion. This index powers <em>Goto Definition,</em> which is exposed in three different ways:</p>
      <br>
      <ul>
          <li>A popup is displayed when hovering over a symbol</li>
          <li>Pressing <button><code>F12</code></button> when the caret is on a symbol</li>
          <li>The <em>Goto Symbol in Project</em> functionality.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>
          Symbol indexing can be customized on a per-synax basis via configuration files, allowing users to tailor the feature to their needs.
      </p>
    <br>
    <b>MULTIPLE SELECTIONS</b>
    <br>
    <p>
        Make ten changes at the same time, not one change ten times. Multiple selections allow you to interactively change many lines at once, rename variable with ease, and manipulate files fater than ever.
    </p>
    <br>
    
       <p> Try pressing <button><code>Ctrl</code></button>+<button><code>Shift</code></button>+<button><code>L</code></button> to split the selection into lines and <button><code>Ctrl</code></button>+<button><code>D</code></button> to select the next occurance of the selected word. To make multiple selections with the mouse, take a look at the <a href="#">Column Selection</a> documentation.</p>
    
    <br>
    <b>COMMAND PALETTE</b>
    <p>
        <em>The command palette</em> holds infrequently used functionality, like sorting chaning the synax, changing the synax ans changing the indentation settings, With just a few keystrokes, you can search for what you want, without ever having to navigate through the menu or rememeber obscure key bindings.
    </p>
        <br>
        <p>
    Show the Command Palette with <button><code>Ctrl</code></button>+<button><code>Shift</code></button>+<button><code>P</code></button>
    </p>
    <br>
    <b>POWERFUL API AND PACKING ECOSYSTEM</b>
    <br>
    <p>
        Sublime Text has a powerful, python <a href="#">API</a> that allow pulgins to augment to built-in functionality.

    </p>
    <br>
    <b>SPLIT EDITING</b>
    <br>
    <p>

You can edit with with as many rows and colums as you wish. Take advantage of multiple monitors by diting with multiple windows, and using multiple splits in each window.
        <br>
        <br>
        Take a look at the<code>View>Layout</code> menu for spliting editing options. TO open multiple views into the one file, use the <code>File>New View into File</code> menu item.
